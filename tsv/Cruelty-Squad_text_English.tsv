Levels\Bonus1.json	json			Darkworld	Entertain Sir John Oliver II	Sir John Oliver II, the Primordial Engine of Suffering, the Punishment Encrypter of the lower planes is bored, again. He has requested us to entertain him by breaking into his mansion and killing him. Simple enough, but nobody who enters ever comes out. Finding an exit might prove to be difficult. Remember to bring a flashlight.	[EOL]
Levels\Bonus2.json	json			Alpine Hospitality	Liquidate Execs\nRetire Daniel Mullins	Ok this is kind of a weird one, I've actually got two jobs for you rather than just one. First and most importantly, some execs of our biggest competing firms have gathered at the opulent Gstaad Ski Resort to make some kind of business deal. Since they've decided to lock us out of this it can't be anything good, so we've come up with a plan of our own to liquidate these execs before they can cause any harm.\nWe also received a gig from the children of the owner of the hotel, Daniel Mullins. They say he has been planning an early retirement and are afraid he's going to waste all his money on complete frivolity, and are going to be left without any inheritance. Retire Daniel and give these kids some peace of mind. Think of it as humanitarian aid.	[EOL]
Levels\Bonus3.json	json			Miner's Miracle	Kill Michael Brain, if he's still alive	The CEO of our subsidiary Godhead Heavy Industries, Michael Brain, was last heard of when he left for some sort of silent retreat in Transnistria. Our sources say he had been suffering from severe burnout and had been talking about leaving the company. We don't know his exact location but you should start where his tracking signal went dead. Track him down and kill him, we have no use for someone so flakey. Shame as he used to be a great leader during his earlier days. I used to be a big fan, even had his poster on my wall.	[EOL]
Levels\Bonus4.json	json			Neuron Activator	Execute The Real Estate Flippers	The former public housing arcology in Helsinki has recently enjoyed bit of a housing market boom as a result of a biological weapons 'accident' wiping out 99% of the population. The new residents enjoy the rough, authentic vibe of the city and spend their nights partying in the former industrial district. The survivors of the depopulation incident and the relatives of the dead have successfully hosted a crowdfunding campaign to get rid of the key people behind their misery. It's rare for us to do this kind of thing for people of working class background but money, like love, is blind and based on transactions.	[EOL]

Levels\BonusEND.json	json			Trauma Loop	Locate the Cradle of Life	As a successful member of society with a stable unflinching psyche and limitless drive, natural affinity for finance and domination, you have been selected, no, you have been effortlessly guided by divine (biological) trauma towards this moment. The gates of destiny fling open, and once again you're left standing on pulsating nothingness. A strobing headache of the soul.	[EOL]
Levels\Level1.json	json			Pharmakokinetiks	Kill the traitors Sigismund and Jerry	Sigismund of the Pharmaceutical Department has been embezzling company funds and using them to gamble with highly speculative biological currencies. This would already be bad enough to warrant his immediate liquidation but he has also become increasingly deranged, flying into fits of rage and vomiting blood all over the office. While you're there you should also dispose of his accomplice, Jerry. He's scheduled to be hosting a meeting in the conference room with other executives.	[EOL]
Levels\Level10.json	json			Idiot Party	ACQUIRE CONTROL UNLIMITED POWER	It's that time again. The elites from all over the world gather at the Rothenburg Fortress and wear their stupid rubber suits and masks. Don't you think it would be really funny if you went there and killed them all? Just fucked them up completely. Imagine their faces behind those masks if you gored their high priest right in front of them. Oh my god. You should really do it don't you think? I mean why not. It would really make your day. They're automatons. They have no souls. Think about it.	[EOL]
Levels\Level11.json	json			Office	Pain	You have to return the four sub-archons to null. You have to eliminate the CAD Elsa Holmes. Exterminate the pests. Tear a hole in CONTROL. Fuck CONTROL.

Levels\Level2.json	json			Paradise	Liquidate the G-TECH team	We recently gave the goofood and biocomputing startup G-TECH a significant seed capital of around five billion dollars. We have also been helping them by supplying proprietary research data which it turns out they have been selling to our competitors for large sums of money. On top of this they have not produced any results and have wasted most of their funding on purchasing chunkopops and expensive properties at an elite gated community built on an ancient mass grave, which will soon hopefully have an addition of three fresh new bodies. Good luck.	[EOL]
Levels\Level3.json	json			Sin Space Engineering	Kill Albrecht, the CEO of Advanced Orbital Instruments	It has come to our attention that the CEO of Advanced Orbital Instruments has been doing too good of a job trying to increase the survival rate of our mission to Mercury, currently estimated at around 20%. This simply won't do as it is first and foremost a sacrificial mission designed to satiate the appetites of some of our higher ups. Once you get rid of him we'll be free to install our own CEO who is more attuned to the concept of mass scale human sacrifice.	[EOL]
Levels\Level4.json	json			Androgen Assault	Annihilate the chief of police and the leader of the narcotics unit	Mark, the chief of the Cult of Order PD has long been useful in enforcing our will on the general populace but has recently started to get sloppy and uncontrollable. His messages, when he actually manages to respond, are completely incoherent and increasingly violent. We believe this rapid change in character has been caused by the experimental steroids supplied to him by the leader of narcotics unit, Magnus. Kill both of them and the Cult of Order can begin its healing process.	[EOL]
Levels\Level5.json	json			Mall Madness	Remove governor Bill Gurney from office	Governor Bill Gurney is going to be hosting a campaign rally in the Cancer City Megamall. He has made a name for himself taking a strong stand against multinational corporations and monopolies. It should be obvious even to a meathead like you that this isn't very good for us. Thankfully our interests align with those of the shadow president and we've been given free hands to do with Bill as we wish. Expect heavy security and keep in mind that the Megamall is ancient and has many forgotten passages.	[EOL]
Levels\Level6.json	json			Apartment Atrocity	Kill your landlord and escape	Now you've done it you freak shit. You've fucked up. You're being tracked by the Grid. The eye in the sky is watching. We're coming for you. Prepare to die.	[EOL]
Levels\Level7.json	json			Seaside Shock	Gut the founding members of the Seasteading Foundation	Hey sorry about the last one... Someone fat fingered the social security number of the target and it ended up being you by accident. Just what are the chances? Well, anyway. A group of seasteaders have recently acquired vast fortunes through biocurrency speculation. It wasn't however enough to attain their dream of building an artificial floating island on the open seas, so they've had to settle for a compromise and have purchased their own cruise ship, the 'Titanium Princess'. It is now a den of pathetic losers living out their depraved fantasies. We wouldn't usually care about this sort of thing but a certain governmental agency has offered us a deal that would secure the funding of the risk management department for years to come. They want these guys to be made an example of what happens when you play sovereign so go full hog I guess haha.	[EOL]
Levels\Level8.json	json			Bog Business	Kill 'WILD PIG'	We have finally discovered the base of the Eternal Swamp Cult. They've been launching assaults against our fracking operations for months now fucking up our profits. If you go in there and kill their leader WILD PIG they'll be sure to devolve into endless infighting and bickering. Remember, don't eat any berries you can't identify.	[EOL]
Levels\Level9.json	json			Casino Catastrophe	Murder the owner of Fatberg Casino	The Corporate Arch Demoness Elsa Holmes recently spent an evening at the esteemed Fatberg Casino and somehow managed to lose the entirety of her vacation bonus. She's been seething mad ever since then and wants revenge. If this was anyone else we'd just laugh it off but since it's her we'll have to do something about it, that is go and murder the owner of the casino in his office. You should try some of the slotmachines while you're there, they're absolutely breathtaking.	[EOL]
